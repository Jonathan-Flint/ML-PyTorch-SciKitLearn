# ML-PyTorch-SciKitLearn

## Repo Outline

This repository is to store and source control some of my self learning projects in python around machine and deep learning. I have recently purchased a copy of Machine Learning with PyTorch and Scikit-Learn by Sebastian Raschka et al which I am going to read and follow along examples with as a primary tool for learning basics of machine learning. I am following the edition of this text first published in February 2022, and this repo is where I intend to store my follow along examples from this text. 

I note here that any code stored within this repository is credited to the authors of the text unless specifically stated otherwise, and the text can be found on Amazon here https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/1801819319?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details

I intend to copy much of the code verbatum from the text as an aid to my learning but will endevour to tinker with the code, or apply concepts learned to my own problems to further suppliment my learning.

## Text Outline

Here I give an outline of each chapter of the text based on the contents pages. I intend to break this repo down into different folders for each chapter of the text to contain my examples from each chapter. In these folders much of the files will be .ipynb files as I will also be making notes in markdown as I read as a way to check my understanding of concepts. I will also include a folder in the repo for any example model built independantly of the text and a further text file listing any acronyms or conventions I use throughout the report

### Chaper 1: Giving Computers the Ability to Learn from Data

This chapter gives an introduction to ML, the different types of ML, lays out terminology used in the text, gives a road map for ML model development and a guide to installing python both directly and through the Anaconda framework. My personal preferance is to use Anaconda for my IDE (99% of the time this is VSCode) and package control.

### Chapter 2: Training Simple Machine Learning Algorithms for Classification

This chapter has a brief history of the field and begins introducing ML concepts like Neural Networks, perceptrons and gradient descent
